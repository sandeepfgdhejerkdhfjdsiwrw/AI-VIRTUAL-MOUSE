# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE
The main objective of the AI virtual mouse system is to control the mouse cursor functions by using the hand gestures instead of using a physical mouse. The proposed system can be achieved by using a webcam or a built-in camera which detects the hand gestures and hand tip and processes these frames to perform the particular mouse functions.
